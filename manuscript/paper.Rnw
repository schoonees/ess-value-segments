% \todo{We need to add text on the necessity of correcting for response style here  plus on the importance of values segments.}
Values are central to public debates today. Human values convey broad goals that serve as guiding principles in a person's life and value priorities differ across people in society. Groups in society holding opposing values (e.g., universalism versus security) will make different choices when voting in an election. Whereas over time, values are relatively stable, the number and type of political parties as well as the political values they communicate and disseminate have been changing. Groups of people holding the same human values may therefore vote for another (new) party in a later election. We focus on analyzing the relationship between human values and voting in elections, introducing a new methodology to analyze how values profiles relate to political support over time. We investigate the Dutch multi-party political system over five waves of the European Social Survey, spanning 2002 until 2010. Whilst previous research has focused on individual values separately and focused on voters only, we (1) distinguish groups holding a similar set of opposing and compatible values (values profile) instead of focusing on single values in the the entire population; (2) incorporate a correction for differences in scale use in our model (3) compare voting over time; (4) include non-voters, a growing group in Dutch society. We find evidence that specific values profiles are related to voting for a specific set of political parties. We also find that specific values profiles distinguish non-voters from voters and that voters for populist parties resemble non-voters.

% \todo{Interessante vraag: tussen welke partijen wordt geswitcht? Welke partijen zitten in de evoked set van mensen in een specifiek waarden segment?}
\doublespace
% \onehalfspace
Recent years have seen substantial changes to political landscapes in many countries \citep{meer2015}. Major established political parties  have lost ground to new parties, most notably the populist parties. Concurrently, both the proportion of the electorate choosing to abstain from voting and the proportion switching between parties are on the rise in many countries \citep[e.g.,][]{eurostat}. One possible reason for these changes in voting behaviour is that the basic human values parties emphasize have become incongruent with the values people hold. We investigate this idea in this paper.

% \todo{Include text on what human values are; distinghuish them from political and moral values to avoid confusion. Use text on history of values as used by Julie in the revised values paper 20160805}

Human values refer to what people hold important in life, for example, freedom, security or power. They motivate what people do and help them to select or justify their behavior \citep{schwartz1992}. For instance, people valuing security will more likely be motivated to vote for a party that promises to ensure their safety (through security values). Moreover, people valuing universalism will likely be  more motivated to vote for a party recognising the positive aspects of immigration and understanding others (appealing at universalism values). When voting for a party reflecting their own human values, people will feel they are behaving in line with their own values. Moreover, human values are more stable over time than political values \citep{vecchione2013} and they enable predicting political choice \citep[e.g.,][]{caprara2006}.

We use the currently dominant theory of human values by \citep{schwartz1992, schwartz2012}. Schwartz proposed a nearly universal structure of 10 human values, which has been validated in over 75 nations worldwide, using various measurement instruments \citep{cieciuch2013}. The theory has been used to assess differences in various behaviors including voting behaviour \citep{schwartz2015}. In the studies on voting behaviour, researchers typically took the political parties or political left-right orientation as a starting point and investigated whether and which specific values differed between parties or orientations. In this way, it is possible to determine which values distinguish one party from another; however, it is not possible to assess which parties voters may choose given their own values profile on the complete set of 10 values.

In the current study we fill this gap, as we start with determining groups (segments) of people having similar profiles on all 10 values. This builds upon the recent finding that the theoretical (circular) structure of values also holds in general within individuals \citep{gollan2014,borg2015}, giving each individual a values profile in which the compatibilities and oppositions between the 10 values can be distinguished. This will be explained further in the theory section. Combined with the notion that people differ with respect to the specific value(s) they consider important and unimportant, we will determine whether distinguisable groups of people with the same values profiles exist in the population.

We also address a main measurement issue in values research, which is that the absolute scores on a specific value do not matter. Rather, it is the relative score in comparison with other values that matters. For instance, it is not the absolute importance a person attaches to the value security, it is the relative importance of security to other values, such as universalism, that matters. Furthermore, as rating scales are used, measures will be contaminated with response styles \citep[e.g.][]{vaerenbergh2013,baumgartner2001}. Response styles are a general tendency to use rating scale categories independent of item content \citep{paulhus1991}. For instance, some respondents will mainly tick the "most important" category, whereas others with the same value priorities will mainly tick the "important" category. Given the differences in scale use, in values measurement, a correction for response style is considered essential \citep{schwartz2007}. As we focus on groups of respondents (segments), we employ the LC-BML model \citep{vanrosmalen2010}; this model enables us to determine values segments corrected for differences in response styles. Moreover, this model enables correcting for different kinds of response styles, not only the common ones such as extreme response style or acquiescence.

Summarizing, in contrast to other studies that focused on how preferences for political parties correlated with specific values \citep{caprara2006, thorisdottir2007, caprara2012}, we look from the perspective of the individual and focus on how their complete values profiles relate to voting for (homogeneous groups of) political parties or to abstain from voting. In particular, our contributions are: 
(1) Assessing how many values segments can be distinguished in the population;
(2) Exploring how these segments relate to voting over time, taking into account that the parties participating in the elections may change, and that people may abstain from voting; and
(3) Exploring whether voting for political parties can be predicted using values segments.

We illustrate our approach by using data from the Netherlands, a nation with a multi-party system where many new parties enter the  political arena, such as in the recent 2017 elections. Moreover, compared to other nations, the Netherlands is a nation in which electoral volatility is very high \citep{dassonneville2013} making the Netherlands a suitable setting for our study.

In the next section, we briefly review the theory of human values.

% /It is to be expected that people will be more likely to vote for the political party that best reflects their own values. Relationships between basic human values and political behaviour have been established in previous research have focused, where the focus has been on relationships between specific human values and choosing whether to vote or abstain \citep{caprara2012}, the left-right dimension in politics \citep{thorisdottir2007}, and voting for specific political parties \citep{barnea1998}. 

% /In these studies, researchers have studied relationships of values with preferences for specific political parties \citep{schwartz2010,barnea1998}, we focus on combinations of personal values people have that together influence voting behaviour.

% \todo{WHY this study??? waarom Nederland: opkomst populist parties; several elections; voting is not compulsory; WAAROM CORRIGEREN VOOR RESPONSE STYLE?}

% /The established method of measuring human values is by using rating scales and people typically differ in the way they use rating scales. Some people prefer to use the positive side of the scale, others prefer extreme options and still others prefer using answring categories around the the midpoint. Such differences in scale use require correcting  \citep{schwartz2007}, since comparing responses between different survey participants should account for the heterogeneous use of rating scales pervasive in such studies \citep[e.g.][]{vaerenbergh2013,baumgartner2001}. Only after disentangling response styles from substantive content can accurate comparisons be made. However, few studies correct for response styles as it is difficult and content-related information might be removed in the process \citep{schoonees2015}. Recently, more advanced alternatives to the commonly used response style indices advocated by \citet{baumgartner2001} have been developed. Specifically, we use the latent-class bilinear multinomial logit (LC-BML) model of \citet{vanrosmalen2010}, which allows us to estimate value segments while at the same time correcting for differences in response style. This correction results in more valid value segments and provides insight into whether specific response styles are more prevalent in specific values segments. The latter also provides insight into which values segments are the most valid.

% /This study, using large representative samples, reports an empirical investigation into the relationship between human values profiles and voting in the Netherlands over a 10 year period in which the political landscape underwent a substantial change.

% /The questions we pose in this study are as follows: How many content-based value segments are there in the Dutch population and how are these value segments related to voting behaviour? How stable is the relationship between the value segments and the political parties over time? What effect do individual differences in response style have on content-based value segments? We start by giving an overview of  and of values theory, followed by political dimensions applied to Dutch politics, a short summary of important recent events that might affecting voting, and an overview of our research propositions. Then we will further describe the LC-BML model and present our results. We end with a discussion and show the relevance of our method to study political change in other multi-party political systems. 

\section*{Human Values}

Human values convey broad goals that serve as guiding principles in a person's life for the selection of behaviours and the evaluation of behaviours and events \citet{schwartz1992}. In the current dominant theory of individual values, \citet{schwartz1992}  distinguishes 10 distinct values, benevolence, universalism, self-direction, stimulation, hedonism, achievement, power, security, conformity and tradition. 

Benevolence refers to protecting the well-being of people with whom one has frequent personal contact. Universalism refers to understanding, tolerating and protecting all people, including those far away and it also includes taking care of nature and the natural environment. Self-direction entails valuing independent thought, opting for action, and being creative and investigative. Stimulation refers to valuing exciting, new and challenging things. Achievement refers to showing personal success by demonstrating competences according to social standards. Power refers to valuing social status and prestige by having control over people and resources. Security refers to safety, harmony, and stability of society, of relationships, and of self. It entails two types of security; one that focuses primarily on individual interests (e.g., avoiding danger, living in a secure environment), the other focuses wider group interests (e.g., having a strong government). Conformity refers to restraint of actions, tendencies, and impulses that can upset or harm others and violate social expectations or norms. Finally, tradition refers to valuing respect for, involvement in and acceptance of ideas that traditional culture or religion requires from people. 

These 10 values are organized in a circular structure that represents the compatible and opposing relationships between the values. Here we briefly discuss this structure, as can be seen in Figure~\ref{F:schwartz-circle}. Relationships between values such as benevolence and universalism or between benevolence and tradition are positive and result in positions adjacent to each other on the circumplex. Benevolence and universalism share the acceptance of others and having concern for their welfare and benevolence and tradition share the importance of involvement in the in-group. The opposing power and benevolence do not coincide as valuing "dominance over others" (power) conflicts with valuing  "protecting the well-being of people with whom one has frequent personal contact" (benevolence); the conflicting perspectives result in a position on opposite sides of the circumplex. %In addition to the 10 values, Schwartz also distinguishes 4 higher order domains, self-transcendence, self-enhancement, openness to change, and conservation.

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/Schwartz-Circle-v2.pdf}
  \caption{Schwartz's value circumplex.} % (Source: \citet{borg2011})
  \label{F:schwartz-circle}
\end{figure}

Studies on human values have long focused on the structure of values across all individuals in a sample. Recent research by \citet{borg2015} shows that the circular structure of values not only exists across individuals, but also tends to hold on an individual basis. Suppose the structure in Figure~\ref{F:schwartz-circle} holds for a particular individual. If she considers benevolence to be of the highest importance, then she will consider the value power to be the least important. Based on this choice of benevolence as the most important, the individual will either consider tradition or universalism as the second most important value. This follows from the adjacency of these values to benevolence in Figure~\ref{F:schwartz-circle}. Suppose she prefers universalism over tradition, then the theory predicts that she will also consider self-direction important, and security and conformity less important.

As people differ in the importance they attach to the different values, we expect that there are distinct groups of people sharing the same value priorities. For instance, there might not only be a group considering security values of highest importance and considering stimulation values of low importance, but also a group considering universalism values of utmost importance and opposing power values. 

 
\section*{Dutch Politics and Political Orientation}
% \subsection*{Political shifts in the early 21st century}
For readers unfamiliar with the Dutch politics, we now describe developments in the Dutch political landscape over the last two decades. Important developments include both specific events and the emergence and disappearance of political parties.

As in other Western nations, Dutch politics have seen a number of important events during the first decade of the 21st century. A main development concerns the emergence of populist parties such as Liveable Netherlands (LN), TON, LPF and PVV. Recent evidence from other countries indicate that this trend is not unique to the Netherlands (e.g., the rise of Front National in France, and of the AfD in Germany). Specific events, such as the September 11 attacks in the United States in 2001, the assassination of the LPF leader Pim Fortuyn shortly before the general election in 2002 (May 6), and the murder of film director Theo van Gogh\footnote{Van Gogh, critical of aspects of Islam in his work, was murdered by radical Dutch Muslim Mohammed Bouyeri, sparking a number of retaliatory incidents.} (November 2, 2004) have helped underscore the issues of the populist parties.   

For a long time there have been three main political parties in the Netherlands: CDA, PvdA and VVD (religious, libertarian/left and right respectively); these parties enjoyed over 80\% of the votes in the 1989 elections. They still enjoyed over 60\% of the votes in 2002. Since 2008, other parties have become larger, such as the left-wing Socialist Party (SP) (9.8\% in 2010) and the populist PVV (15\% in 2010). The growth of these latter parties came at the expense of the three long-established parties. In the 2017 elections, five parties received only about 70\% of the votes; the VVD, PVV, CDA, D66 and GL (Green Left) now belong to the larger parties. Another change during the last decade is that the number of small parties with a few seats in parliament is increasing; for instance a party focused on animal welfare (PvdD) has five seats, and a party focused on the elderly (50PLUS) has four. Consequently, 13 parties are now represented in the Dutch parliament: the political landscape has become more diverse. 

In the last years the larger old established parties, a few smaller parties with a specific program (e.g., PvdD focussing on animal rights) and the populist party (PVV) coexist. To describe the political arena in the Netherlands, \citet{aarts2008} identify three dimensions: left versus right, authoritarian versus libertarian and religious versus secular. In their context, left (right) indicates opposition to (support for) differences in social equality between people and support for (opposition to) a strong role for government in society. In particular, right is primarily opposed to the state having a strong influence on the economy: it considers private enterprise important and accepts inequality in society. Authoritarian versus libertarian primarily relates to dealing with people from other cultures and law enforcement. On the libertarian side, people are open to other cultures and non-conformist practices such as abortion or euthanasia, whereas authoritarians are more traditional, less open to foreign cultures and consider law enforcement to be important. Finally, the religion dimension concerns the role that the church should play in society on moral issues. These three dimensions are not independent, left coincides with libertarian and right with authoritarian. 

According to  \citet{aarts2008}, in the Netherlands the religious dimension distinguishes the strictly religious SGP (Reformed Political Party), the CU (Christian Union) and to a lesser extent the CDA (Christian Democrats) from the other parties. The libertarian versus authoritarian dimension distinguishes the D66 (Democrats 1966), GL (Green Left), PvdA and SP (both socialist parties) from the other parties. Finally, the left-right dimension distinguishes the VVD and the new populist parties, such as the PVV, from the other parties. In the next sections we will use this categorization of Dutch parties based on these larger political orientations: the religious (SGP, CU, CDA), libertarian left-wing (GL, D66, PvdD), left-wing (PvdA, SP), right-wing (VVD), and populist (LPF, LN, PVV, TON) categories. We will add non-voters as a separate category. Each of these (groups of) parties focuses on specific topics that might appeal to basic human values held by different segments of people in the electorate. 

In the next section, we discuss our expectations on relations between values segments and political orientation.

\section*{Expectations}

In this exploratory study, the number and type of values segments that will emerge is purely data driven. Yet the literature points to some types of segments that will likely be uncovered. While the priority people give to specific human values are relatively stable over time \citep{schwartz2006}, the political landscape in Europe, and in the Netherlands in particular, has changed due to the emergence and disappearance of political parties in recent years. This suggests that for some (segments of) voters their best-fitting political parties may have changed. As most people aim to achieve congruence between their values on the one hand and behaviour on the other \citep{edwards2009}, this implies that people may feel the need to change their vote to another (new) political party. 

Below we list our four main expectations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item We expect that people who highly value universalism and self-direction, and to a lesser extent benevolence, have a positive stance toward outgroups and people who are different from themselves, such as immigrants or refugees \citep{davidov2008,schwartz2010}. They value equal opportunities and taking initiative. When individuals are driven by values such as universalism and self-direction, they will be less motivated to have control, status and be secure and safe. Consequently, values such as power and security will be considered less important. Such a values profile is congruent with programs of left-wing and libertarian political parties \citep{caprara2006}. We therefore expect that there is a segment considering benevolence, universalism, self-direction and stimulation of particular importance, and power and security values of low importance which predominantly votes for left or libertarian parties. 

\item For people who consider the security values and the adjacent power values relatively more important, it is important to keep the status quo. They prefer a stable society in which traditions are respected and conflicts with existing social standards and expectations are minimized. When power, security, and tradition drive their attitudes and behaviours they are willing to accept that they need to trade-off these values with universalism and self-direction values. This means they are willing to accept less freedom and independence (de-emphasizing self-direction), to be able to live a familiar and safe environment (emphasizing security). For people holding such a values profile, there is a clear congruence with right-wing parties that emphasize maintenance of the status quo, acceptance of inequality in society and strict rules, which relate to power, security and tradition but oppose universalism and self-direction. Moreover, the right-wing parties also emphasize the negative side of immigration, which is compatible with security (and opposes universalism). We therefore expect that there is a segment emphasizing power and security values and opposing universalism values anticipated to vote for right-wing or authoritarian parties.

\item Religiousness is positively related to the values conformity and tradition \citep{schwartz1995}. Being strictly religious coincides with traditional (gender) roles, conformity to rules, and taking care of people in the ingroup. Values such as tradition and conformity are held at the expense of opposite values such as hedonism and stimulation. In addition, the religious are expected to consider benevolence to be more important than universalism as benevolence values emphasizes the traditional in-group more. A resulting circular values profile, with tradition values important and stimulation unimportant, resonates with the values of the religious parties that consider the role of the church in society of key importance. Specifically, it is expected that there is a segment highlighting conformity, tradition, and security as highly important and considering the opposing values self-direction, stimulation, and hedonism as opposed to their values. We expect such a segment to vote for religious parties.

\item In the aforementioned three segments, we assume people to have a clear distinct values profile on the ten values, with some values being important guiding principles and other values being opposed to these important values with the remaining values in between. However, some people may have less outspoken value preferences and may consider all values of about equal importance. Such a less distinct values profile may have a substantive or a methodological reason. Only a small part of the population  may have outspoken values profiles in which clear trade-offs between values are made, which may be an adaptive tendency \citep{borg2015}. Moreover, it may be easier to function if one does not have very strong value preferences or rejections, as the number and severity of conflicts one encounters then may be less. A methodological reason may be that respondents may not differentiate between the value items because they find the items in the questionnaire too difficult or abstract, or are less motivated to fill in the questionnaire and just tick what is easiest, also called a satisficing response tendency \citep{kaminska2010}. Given this, we expect that there will be segments where people have values profiles that resemble the three aforementioned ones, but there may also be other segments; these latter segments may even reflect response styles rather than substantive content. 

\end{enumerate}

Finally, we expect to make some interesting findings about non-voters. This group includes both people who are not eligible to vote, for instance people younger than 18 and non-Dutch citizens, and eligible voters who decided not to vote. In the analysis, we also aim to find a values profile associated with not voting. There is very little research on the relation between values and not voting. An exception is the study in Italy by \citet{caprara2012}, which suggests that non-voters' values may not resonate with the values existing political parties advocate. In the Netherlands, universalism is advocated by libertarian left-wing; tradition by religious parties; and power and security by right-wing parties. Given the circular theoretical structure of values (see Figure 1), we expect that non-voters will consider other values than universalism, power, security and tradition as the most important guiding principles in their lives. 

Summarizing, we expect to find a small number of segments of people differing in the importance they attach to the 10 human values. These segments are then linked to voting behaviour. Our expectations are to uncover both segments of people with clear values profiles, as well as other segments with potentially less pronounced profiles. There is no guarantee that all segments will be compatible with Schwartz's theory.

\section*{Response Styles}

Response styles have long been acknowledged as an issue in public opinion research \citep[for example,][] {peter2011,greenleaf1992,alwin1985,bachman1984,cunningham1977,oneill1967}. When answering survey questions using rating scales, people use the scale in a different way. Some tend to use the positive side of the scale, whereas others prefer to spread the answers across all available response categories, and still others prefer using the extreme categories only. Such differences in scale use contaminate the findings as they do not reveal differences in substantive content. For instance, a person using the scale categories "1" and "2", and another person using the categories "2" and "3" can have the same values profile; the only difference is in the average across all values. Such a difference needs to be corrected for. Furthermore, some response styles can be problematic such as a style where people hardly differentiate between items (e.g., use one scale category only). In values research correcting for response styles is a recommended procedure \citep{schwartz2007} and we use the LC-BML model \citep{vanrosmalen2010} that enables us to separate response style from substantive content in segmentation studies. Next, we introduce this model.

\section*{The LC-BML Model}
% In values data it is of interest how a person assesses the complete set of values relative to each other. Thus neither the overall importance across all values, nor the specific rating an item receives is relevant. Differences between people in response style when assessing values therefore needs to be separated from content relevant information on these values. 

To determine values segments free from response styles, we use the latent-class bilinear multinomial logit model \citep[LC-BML model;][]{vanrosmalen2010}. This model is a multivariate generalization of the standard multinomial (or baseline-category) logit model for multinomial responses \citep[e.g.][]{agresti2002}, which in turn is the multicategory extension of logistic regression. The multinomial logit model describes the probability that a respondent answers a single item with a given rating. The LC-BML model combines such models for multiple items in order to describe the responses of a respondent on all items simultaneously. The input for the model are items measured on rating scales; in the model the rating categories are considered as nominal and thus categories such as "no answer" can be added.

Furthermore, the model allocates all respondents into two types of segments (or latent classes), namely values and response style segments. This is done by allowing the model parameters to vary between segments. The response style segments correct for the differences in response styles, while the value segments indicate differences in the importance attached to the respective values. Hence each person is assigned simultaneously to both a response style segment and a value segment by the LC-BML model. %Another feature is the use of a bilinear decomposition of the model parameters so that the effects can be summarized parsimoniously with the help of biplots \citep[e.g.][]{gower2011}.

We will now describe the LC-BML model in more detail requiring some notation. Let $Y_{ij}$ be the random variable denoting the response of respondent $i \; (i = 1, \ldots, N)$ to item $j$. Index by $k \; (k = 1, \ldots, K)$ the common rating scale used for all $J$ items. Missing responses are included by adding a dedicated `Missing' category to the rating scale. Let there be $R$ and $S$ latent classes for the response style and value segments respectively. Supposing that $\pi_{rs}$ is the prior probability that any respondent belongs to segments $r$ and $s$, it follows that
\begin{equation}
  \Prob (Y_{ij} = k)  = \sum_{r=1}^{R} \sum_{s=1}^{S} \pi_{rs} \Prob (Y_{ij} = k \, | \, r, s).
\end{equation}
In the LC-BML model, the segment-specific probabilities follow multinomial logit models such that
\begin{equation}
  \Prob (Y_{ij} = k \, | \, r, s) = 
    \frac{\exp \left( \eta_{ijk \, | \, r, s} \right)}
         {\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \exp \left( \eta_{ijk \, | \, r, s}  \right)},
\end{equation}
where $\eta_{ijk \, | \, r, s}$ is a segment-specific linear predictor. The basic form of the linear predictor is 
\begin{equation}
  \eta_{ijk \, | \, r, s} = \alpha_{k \, | \, r} + \sum_{l=1}^{L} \vect{\beta}_{kl}^{'} \vect{x}_{il}
    + \gamma_{jk \, | \, s}.
    \label{E:linpred}
\end{equation}
Here $\alpha_{k \, | \, r}$ is the attractiveness of rating $k$ in response style segment $r$, $\vect{x}_{il}$ is an indicator vector indicating which category of the (discretized) socio-demographic variable $l \; (l = 1, \ldots, L)$ person $i$ belongs to, $\vect{\beta}_{kl}^{'}$ is the transpose of the vector of effects for this socio-demographic variable on category $k$, and $\gamma_{jk \, | \, s}$ is the effect of rating $k$ on item $j$ in value segment $s$. Finally, a bilinear decomposition is applied to the parameters in \eqref{E:linpred}, a description of which is deferred to the \hyperref[S:App]{Supporting Information}. This decomposition serves two purposes, namely to reduce the number of parameters to be estimated and to allows for all effects to be interpreted graphically in biplots. Note that the dimensionality $P$ of this decomposition determines the dimensionality of these biplots. 

For a given choice of the number of segments $R$ and $S$, and dimensionality $P$, the LC-BML model is estimated by maximum likelihood via the Expectation-Maximization \citep[EM;][]{dempster1977} algorithm. The likelihood contribution of person $i$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{r=1}^{R} \sum_{s=1}^{S} \pi_{rs} \prod_{j=1}^{J} \prod_{k=1}^{K}
    \Prob (Y_{ij} = k \, | \, r,s)^{I(y_{ij} = k)},
\end{equation}
with $y_{ij}$ being the realized value of $Y_{ij}$ and $I(\cdot)$ the indicator function. An important by-product of the estimation algorithm is the estimated posterior probabilities of each person belonging to each of the $R \times S$ latent classes, which can be calculated as
\begin{equation}
  \pi_{rs} (i) = 
    \frac{\pi_{rs} \prod_{j = 1}^{J} \prod_{k=1}^{K} 
           \Prob (Y_{ij} = k \, | \, r,s)^{I(y_{ij} = k)}}
         {\sum_{r=1}^{R} \sum_{s=1}^{S}
         \pi_{rs} \prod_{j = 1}^{J} \prod_{k=1}^{K} 
           \Prob (Y_{ij} = k \, | \, r,s)^{I(y_{ij} = k)}}.
  \label{E:posterior}
\end{equation}

The model gives a posterior measure of class membership for all individuals. These measures can for instance be aggregated over the respondents' self-reported voting behaviour to establish how people within each segment voted. Information criteria, such as the Akaike Information Criterion \citep[AIC;][]{akaike1974} or Schwarz's Bayesian Information Criterion \citep[BIC;][]{schwarz1978} can be used to select the number of segments $R$ and $S$, as well as the dimensionality $P$. An alternative is the graphical CHull procedure of \citet{ceulemans2011}. We opt for a combination of the BIC and the CHull procedure. The BIC has been shown to work well in conjunction with the LC-BML model \citep{vanrosmalen2010}.

This study uses five rounds of the European Social Survey (ESS), namely those of 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010. The ESS is a large scale high-quality cross-national survey conducted biennially in approximately 25 European countries, including the Netherlands \citep{jowell2007}. The survey covers representative samples of individuals of 15 years or older who live in the respective nations, with in total \Sexpr{nrow(essall)} respondents from the Netherlands.

For the current study, we use the \Sexpr{nrow(essnl)} Dutch respondents from the 5 ESS waves for which information on key variables were available. For details on data collection procedures, see \url{www.europeansocialsurvey.org}. The number of respondents per ESS wave were \Sexpr{paste(table(essnl$essround)[1:4], collapse = ", ")} and \Sexpr{table(essnl$essround)[5]} respectively.

We use the 21 value items available in the ESS \citep[Schwartz Portrait Values Questionnaire, PVQ21;][]{schwartz2001,schwartz2007}, which measures the 10 different values. Each of these values are measured by two items, except for universalism. Universalism has three items, because it covers both tolerance to people in the outgroup as well protection of nature. All items are gender-specific and operationalized by statements such as one of the items on self-direction: `Thinking up new ideas and being creative is important for her. She likes to do things in her own original way.' The answering scale for the PVQ-ESS is a 6-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (`Very much like me') to 6 (`Not like me at all'); the category 7 ("no answer") was added when scores were missing. In total, \Sexpr{length(setdiff(essall$idno, rawdat$idno))} respondents were removed who supplied no information on the 21 value items.

We include demographic information on age, gender and education. Since discrete covariates are required for the LC-BML model, both years of education and age were discretized into three categories. For years of education, the categories were low (1 to 10 years; comparable to ISCED\footnote{See \url{http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/isced-2011-en.pdf}.} levels 1 and 2), intermediate (11 to 15 years; ISCED levels 3 -- 5) and high (16+ years; ISCED level 6 or higher). Age was divided into the categories 15 to 34 years, 35 to 59 years and 60 to 96 years. Respondents with missing values for the above-mentioned socio-demographic variables were removed from the analysis (\Sexpr{sum(!complete.cases(x))} persons), together with respondents who used the same rating to answer all 21 value items (\Sexpr{sum(apply(y, 1, function(x) all(x == x[1])))} persons). After removing these respondents, \Sexpr{nrow(essnl)} observations were used in the LC-BML analysis. Note that although sampling weights are applicable in the ESS, it was not possible to apply them in the LC-BML analysis due to software limitations. We do however apply post-stratification weights in summary statistics, which corrects for the sampling design and unit non-response. 

In the ESS, respondents were also asked to indicate whether they voted in the most recent elections for the Second Chamber of Parliament\footnote{This is the main legislative body of the Netherlands.}, and, if so, for which political party. For the 2002 survey, this concerned the Dutch elections of 6 May 2002, for 2004 the elections of 22 January 2003, for both 2006\footnote{Data collection for the third ESS wave started in September 2006, before the election took place in November. Respondents interviewed before the election were asked who they intended to vote for. After the election they were asked who they actually voted for. Roughly half the sample were interviewed before the election. In the questionnaire, LN was still given as a voting option. However, LN disbanded before the 2006 elections, hence we do not consider LN when interpreting voting behaviour after 2004.} and 2008 the elections of 22 November 2006 and for 2010 the elections of 9 June 2010. The official election results are given in Table~\ref{T:NL_perc_vote} in the \hyperref[S:App]{Supporting Information}. Of the people who indicated that they voted, not all people disclosed the party they voted for. The disclosure rates for those who indicated that they voted were quite high at \Sexpr{paste(myform(100*(1-propvote.party.missing[-5])), collapse = "\\%, ")}\% and \Sexpr{myform(100*(1-propvote.party.missing[5]))}\% respectively. 

Note that voting is not mandatory in the Netherlands. In recent elections, roughly 75\% to 80\% of the electorate chose to vote for the Second Chamber of Parliament. The weighted proportion of eligible respondents in our sample who indicated that they voted is slightly higher at \Sexpr{paste(myform(100*propelig.vote[-5]), collapse = "\\%, ")}\% and  \Sexpr{myform(100*propelig.vote[5])}\% for the 5 ESS waves respectively. For our analyses, we include an explicit category, in addition to the party voted for, for respondents who chose not to vote. In addition to the people who deliberately chose not to vote, approximately \Sexpr{myform(100*eligprop)}\% of the sample was not eligible to vote, mostly on account of being younger than 18 at the time of the election. The latter two groups are merged in our analyses. 

\subsection*{Analysis Procedure}

We start the analyses with estimating the value segments and response style segments with the LC-BML model. To enable the correction for response styles, all 21 value items are used as input for the analysis. We do not combine the items into the 10 value types. The latter is an advantage as we can still observe differences in topics considered important by the respondents; for instance, universalism includes not only equality of people but also care for nature and security includes both national security and security in the familiar environment. Next, we use correspondence analysis to determine and vizualize the relationships between values segments and voting over time. Finally, to assess whether values segments can be used to predict voting for specific groups of political parties, we perform multinomial logistic regression analysis.

When discussing voting results below, we will use weights to relate socio-demographics to voting over time. Since the results of the relevant elections are publicly available at the population level (see Table~\ref{T:NL_perc_vote}), we use these to recalibrate the post-stratification weights from the ESS before analyzing the voting behaviour. These recalibrated weights are constructed so that the proportion of votes for all competing parties as well as the proportion of nonvoters in the observed sample match the official election results as closely as possible. Iterative proportional fitting, also known as raking, was used to construct these weights separately for each wave of the ESS \citep[see Chapter 8 of][for example]{lohr1999}. These weights are subsequently used whenever voting behaviour is considered. This recalibration procedure also adjusts for the respondents not eligible to vote in the elections, as well as the small proportion who did vote but either chose not to disclose for which party they voted, or could not recall which party they supported. This is done by increasing the weights of the remaining respondents such that the total weight for the eligible voters equals that of the entire sample.

In order to select the most appropriate model, we fitted the LC-BML model for $R = 1, 2, \ldots, 20$ response style segments, $S = 1,2,  \ldots, 12$ value segments, and $P = 1, 2$ dimensions. In total \Sexpr{20 * 12 * 2} different models were considered; however \Sexpr{nrow(dat) - sum(complete.cases(dat))} models did not converge in the allotted number of EM iterations (10 000) and were discarded. The EM algorithm is however only guaranteed to find a local optimum of the likelihood function. We therefore estimated each of these models for 20 different random starts to increase our chances of finding the global optimum. Only the start which resulted in the highest value of the likelihood function is retained. 
% A numerical convergence criterion of $10^{-5}$ was used.

We plotted the maximized log-likelihood values against the model degrees-of-freedom for the \Sexpr{nrow(na.omit(dat))} models. The convex hull enclosing the cloud of points can then be determined. We reduced the model selection problem by considering only the models that lie on this hull, similar to the CHull prodecure of \citet{ceulemans2011}. These models can be considered to present a good trade-off between complexity and data fit. We selected the model with $R = 20$ response styles, $S = 7$ values segments and $P = 2$ dimensions from the remaining \Sexpr{length(hull)} models, since it is more parsimonious than the more complex models. Our chosen model obtained the fourth lowest BIC value, but used significantly fewer degrees-of-freedom than the other models in the top five, ranked according to BIC. We now proceed to describe and interpret the results from this model.

% \vspace*{30pt}

% A total of \Sexpr{nrow(rawdat)} respondents from the Netherlands were available across the 5 ESS waves. Respondents with missing values for the abovementioned socio-demographic variables were removed from the analysis (\Sexpr{sum(!keep.compl)} persons), together with respondents who used the same rating to answer all 21 value items (\Sexpr{sum(!keep.const)} persons). After removing these respondents, \Sexpr{nrow(essnl)} observations were used in the analysis. The numbers of respondents per ESS wave were \Sexpr{paste(table(essnl$essround)[-5], collapse = ", ")} and \Sexpr{paste(table(essnl$essround)[5])} respectively.  Note that although sampling weights are applicable in the ESS, it was not possible to apply them in the LC-BML analysis due to software limitations. We do however apply post-stratification weights in summary statistics, which corrects for the sampling design and unit nonresponse. 

% In the ESS, respondents were also asked to indicate whether they voted in the most recent elections for the Second Chamber of Parliament\footnote{This is the main legislative body of the Netherlands.}, and, if so, for which political party. For the 2002 survey, this concerned the Dutch elections of 6 May 2002, for 2004 the elections of 22 January 2003, for both 2006\footnote{Data collection for the third ESS wave started in September 2006, before the election took place in November. Respondents interviewed before the election were asked who they intended to vote for. After the election they were asked who they actually voted for. Roughly half the sample were interviewed before the election. In the questionnaire, LN was still given as a voting option. However, LN disbanded before the 2006 elections, hence we do not consider LN when interpreting voting behaviour after 2004.} and 2008 the elections of 22 November 2006 and for 2010 the elections of 9 June 2010. The official election results are given in Table~\ref{T:NL_perc_vote} in the \hyperref[S:App]{Appendix}.
%The official election results are given in the \hyperref[S:App]{Appendix}.  %See \hyperref[S:App]{Appendix} for a summary of the self-reported votes in the ESS and the official election results. %\todo{Chi-square test reveals significant differences, and it can also be spotted by eye. Also, LN did not participate in the 2006 elections but was included in the 2008 survey. This implies that the data is flawed and we therefore cannot generalize to the population. }
%We compared the spread across the political parties in the ESS with the official election results, and these were seen to show significant correspondence for all years.

% \subsection*{Nonresponse Calibration}

% Voting is not mandatory in the Netherlands. In recent elections, roughly 20\% to 25\% of the electorate chose not to vote. The weighted proportion of eligible respondents in our sample who indicated that they voted is slightly higher at \Sexpr{paste(myform(100*propelig.vote[-5]), collapse = "\\%, ")}\% and \Sexpr{myform(100*propelig.vote[5])}\% for the 5 ESS waves respectively. We include an explicit group for persons who chose not to vote in our analyses of the reported voting behaviour. Besides these individuals, approximately \Sexpr{myform(100*eligprop)}\% of the respondents were not eligible to vote, mostly on account of being younger than 18 at the time of the election.  Moreover, the ESS asked respondents which political parties they voted for. The disclosure rates for those who indicated that they voted were quite high at \Sexpr{paste(myform(100*(1-propvote.party.missing[-5])), collapse = "\\%, ")}\% and \Sexpr{myform(100*(1-propvote.party.missing[5]))}\% respectively. 

% Since the results of the relevant elections are known at the population level (see Table~\ref{T:NL_perc_vote}), we use these to recalibrate the post-stratification weights from the ESS before analyzing the voting behaviour. These recalibrated weights are constructed so that the proportion of votes for all competing parties as well as the proportion of nonvoters in the observed sample match the official election results as closely as possible. Iterative proportional fitting, also known as raking, was used to construct these weights separately for each wave of the ESS \citep[see Chapter 8 of][for example]{lohr1999}. These weights are subsequently used whenever voting behaviour is considered. This recalibration procedure also adjusts for the respondents not eligible to vote in the elections, as well as the small proportion who did vote but either chose not to disclose for which party they voted, or could not recall which party they supported. This is done by increasing the weights of the remaining respondents such that the total weight for the eligible voters equals that of the entire sample. %This assumes that the information is missing at random, according to the taxonomy of \citet{little1987}.

% We rather assume that the self-reported voting behaviour is missing at random, in which case the missingness can be explained wholly by observed variables. This is a less stringent assumption, but an assumption nonetheless.

%' 
%' Accordingly, the post-stratification weights supplied in the ESS are subjected to weighting-class adjustments \citep[see Chapter 8 of][for example]{lohr1999}. The idea is to split the data into different classes according to the values of observed (demographic) variables, and then to adjust the weights of the observed responses by a constant factor in each class so that the total weight for the observed responses equals the total weight for all responses in that class. If respondents in these classes are alike with respect to voting behaviour, reweighting within the classes should eliminate any nonresponse bias. 
%' 
%' The demographic variables Age, Education Years and Gender were used for constructing these classes, with \Sexpr{length(levels(age.fact))} and \Sexpr{length(levels(eduyrs.fact))} roughly equal-sized classes used for Age and Education Years respectively. Care is taken to ensure that the classes constructed contain at least 30 observations each, and that the majority of these persons disclosed their voting behaviour (after weighting). However, only \Sexpr{formatC(100 * propresp[1, 1, 1], format = "f", digits = 0)}\% and \Sexpr{formatC(100*propresp[1, 2, 1], format = "f", digits = 0)}\% of males and \Sexpr{formatC(100 * propresp[1, 1, 2], format = "f", digits = 0)}\% and \Sexpr{formatC(100*propresp[1, 2, 2], format = "f", digits = 0)}\% of females with 1 to 10 and 11 to 13 years of education respectively disclosed their vote. Hence for these categories we collapse over Education Years before adjusting the weights. All other classes had satisfactory response rates.

% A mean hierarchy of human values often exists in society. \citet{schwartz2001} identified pan-cultural norms, in other words norms that apply generally in every society. According to their findings, people across the world consider values such as benevolence, self-direction and universalism to be the most important; power, tradition and stimulation are considered the least important. This is also true in the Netherlands, as the weighted mean ratings reported in Table~\ref{T:val_items} shows. Dutch people consider values such as self-direction (SD1; average score \Sexpr{formatC(weighted.mean(essparty$impfree, essparty$pspwght), format = "f", digits = 2)}), universalism (UN1; \Sexpr{formatC(weighted.mean(essparty$ipeqopt, essparty$pspwght), format = "f", digits = 2)}) and benevolence (BE2; \Sexpr{formatC(weighted.mean(essparty$iplylfr, essparty$pspwght), format = "f", digits = 2)}) to be important. Power (PO2; \Sexpr{formatC(weighted.mean(essparty$iprspot, essparty$pspwght), format = "f", digits = 2)}) and stimulation (ST2; \Sexpr{formatC(weighted.mean(essparty$ipadvnt, essparty$pspwght), format = "f", digits = 2)}) are considered to be relatively unimportant. The least important is power (PO1; \Sexpr{formatC(weighted.mean(essparty$imprich, essparty$pspwght), format = "f", digits = 2)}). This ordering of the average responses is stable over time: the minimum Spearman rank correlation of the average rating score per item between the various ESS rounds is \Sexpr{formatC(min(mns.cor), format = "f", digits = 2)}. We use the LC-BML model to find more refined subsets of respondents who exhibit different value hierarchies.

% \subsection*{MODEL SELECTION}

% In order to select the most appropriate model, we fitted the LC-BML model for $R = 1, 2, \ldots, 20$ response style segments, $S = 1,2,  \ldots, 12$ value segments, and $P = 1, 2$ dimensions. In total \Sexpr{20*12*2} different models were considered; however \Sexpr{nrow(dat) - sum(complete.cases(dat))} models did not converge in the allotted number of EM iterations (10 000) and were discarded. A numerical convergence criterion of $10^{-5}$ was used. The EM algorithm is however only guaranteed to find a local optimum of the likelihood function. We therefore estimated each of these models for 20 different random starts to increase our chances of finding the global optimum. Only the start which resulted in the highest value of the likelihood function is retained. 

% We plotted the maximized log-likelihood values against the model degrees-of-freedom for the \Sexpr{nrow(na.omit(dat))} models. The convex hull enclosing the cloud of points can then be determined. We reduced the model selection problem by considering only the models that lie on this hull, similar to the CHull prodecure of \citet{ceulemans2011}. These models can be considered to present a good trade-off between complexity and data fit. The BIC values for the \Sexpr{length(hull)} models that lie on this hull are summarized in Table~\ref{T:BIC}. Although it has only the fourth lowest BIC value, we selected the model with $R = 20$ response styles, $S = 7$ value segments and $P = 2$ dimensions, since we found this model to be more interpretable than the more complex models with slightly better BIC values. We now proceed to describe and interpret the results from this model.

Our selected model has 2 dimensions, 20 response styles and 7 values segments. The response style segments indicate that respondents indeed differ in the way they use the rating scale for assessing the 21 value items. Figure~\ref{F:respstyle-facets} (left panel) gives the proportion of responses in each response style (RS) segment that was attributed to each of the ratings. Colours are used to highlight larger values. It is evident that a variety of response styles have been detected. The largest styles (RS1 -- RS3) concentrate on using ratings one through five, but very few sixes. RS4 focuses on using ratings two and three, while RS5 uses the breadth of the rating scale. RS9 and RS10 can be described as midpoint scoring, while RS16 comprises extreme scoring focusing on categories 1 and 6. RS18 and RS20 contain a disproportionate number of missing values. These results show that there is indeed substantial heterogeneity with respect to rating scale use.

Figure~\ref{F:respstyle-facets} also shows the association between the response style segments and values segments. The percentages in each column sums to one, showing which segments each response style is associated with. Some response style segments are often strongly associated with a single value segment. This is especially true for Segments V and VII. Specifically, Segment VII associates strongly with response styles RS18 and RS20 (missing values on many value items), and Segment V with RS13 -- RS16 and RS19. The latter include some well-known styles \citep[see][for example]{baumgartner2001}, such as response range (RS13), acquiescence (RS14 and RS15), extreme responding (RS16) and disacquiescence (RS19). As Segment VII reflects a small segment of people (comprising \Sexpr{myform(100*temptab.prop[7, 6])}\% of the sample) who evidently skipped questions, we do not further describe this segment in the next sections. We will come back to the issues in Segment V when describing this segment in the next sections.

The bilinear decomposition in the LC-BML model represents the values segments in two dimensional perceptual maps or biplots. The first dimension distinguishes positive responses (1 = ``very much like me"), from very negative responses (6 = ``not like me at all"), with the other response categories arranged in between. The second dimension distinguishes responses in the middle of the rating scale indicating moderate importance (3 and 4) from the category "no answer". From a substantive viewpoint, the first dimension is the most informative. We base the discussion below on this dimension only, using one-dimensional plots included in the main text, and defer the full two-dimensional plots to the \hyperref[S:App]{Supporting Information}.

The seven values segments, Segments I through VII, reveal different value priorities which can be seen in the barplots in Figure~\ref{F:seg-barplots}. For ease of interpretation, the bars are coloured green for values considered more important than average and red for those considered less important than average. The value items are grouped by value (e.g., the two benevolence items, BE1 and BE2, are next to each other), and ordered according to Schwartz' theory. Next, we interpret each value segment, in descending order according to size.

% The segments differ in size with the largest segment (I) consisting of 22\% of the sample and the smallest segment (VI) of 14.3\%.  

\emph{Segment I}. Segment I in the left upper corner in Figure~\ref{F:seg-barplots} is the largest group, comprising roughly \Sexpr{myform(100 * segprop[1])}\% of the sample. From the figure, we see that this segment considers the values universalism, benevolence, and to a lesser extent self-direction as being important guiding principles in their lives. Values opposing these values such as power and achievement are scored as unimportant, which means being motivationally incompatible with their values. It is interesting to observe that in this segment stimulation and in particular the item on `living an exciting life' (ST2), is considered to be completely opposed to their values. In the values profile of Segment I, the trade-off that may be experienced between the values benevolence (BE) and universalism (UN) versus power (PO) and achievement (AC) in Schwartz' theory is clearly present. 

\emph{Segment II}. In comparison with Segment I, people in Segment II  (\Sexpr{myform(100 * segprop[2])}\%) do have a less outspoken values profile that clearly follows the values theory. People in Segment II do not clearly oppose values as people in segment I do. However, in comparison to the other segments, they consider the values self-direction (independence), security and achievement as relatively important, whereas tradition (and humility in particular) is considered opposed to their values.


\emph{Segment III}. Compared to the other segments, people in Segment III (\Sexpr{myform(100 * segprop[3])}\%) consider the conservation values (security, conformity and tradition) far more important as guiding principles in their lives than the other segments do. They also oppose the openness values, and stimulation and hedonism in particular. The value priorities of people in this segment follow the circumplex structure. They make a trade-off between conservation values and openness values; for instance, to be able to live properly and follow the customs handed down by religion or family (CO2 and TR1) they are willing to give up an exciting life (ST2) and looking for new things to do in life (ST1).


\emph{Segment IV}. People in Segment IV (\Sexpr{myform(100 * segprop[4])}\%) place relatively great emphasis on self-direction (SD1, independence), universalism (and UN2, understanding others different from them in particular). Tradition (TR) and conformity (CO) are opposed to these values. Values representing making independent decisions are the main motivation of people in this segment; power and being rich is not important. A clear trade-off is made between these sets of values, as can be seen in Figure~\ref{F:seg-barplots}. Being independent, open to others and being loyal to friends are key values and to attain this, people in segment IV are willing to give up living in a secure environment and being rich.

\emph{Segment V}. This segment, comprising \Sexpr{myform(100 * segprop[5])}\% of the sample, hardly differentiates between the values. They consider all values of about equal importance. As most other segments, they consider benevolence and universalism values more and power and achievement values less important, but they do not have clear outspoken value preferences nor do they make clear trade-offs between values. 

\emph{Segment VI}. People in Segment VI (\Sexpr{myform(100 * segprop[6])}\%) consider the values self-direction, stimulation, hedonism and achievement as important motivational goals in their lives. Of the two benevolence values, only being loyal to friends is relatively more important. It should be noted that the values considered important are all focused on own pleasure and success. This can also be seen in the importance, relative to other segments, attached to being rich and being respected by others. Compatible with this, universalism is considered a far less important motivational goal. Furthermore this is the only segment in which taking care of nature and the environment (UN3) is considered unimportant.

Information on socio-demographics and the evolution of values segment sizes over time can be found in the \hyperref[S:App]{Supporting Information}. Next, we consider how the relations between values segments and voting developed over time. 


% As shown in Table~\ref{T:segsizes_vs_yr}, the sizes of the value segments are relatively stable over time. This is expected as values at a higher aggregation level hardly change \citep{schwartz2006}. Segment 4 has grown somewhat over the years from \Sexpr{myform(100*temptab.prop[4, 1])}\% to \Sexpr{myform(100*temptab.prop[4, 5])}\%, whilst Segments 3 and 5 have decreased in size from \Sexpr{myform(100*temptab.prop[3,1])}\% and \Sexpr{myform(100*temptab.prop[5,1])}\% to \Sexpr{myform(100*temptab.prop[3,5])}\% and \Sexpr{myform(100*temptab.prop[5,5])}\% respectively. Overall, Segment 7 is estimated to contain only \Sexpr{myform(100*temptab.prop[7,6])}\% of the population, while the other segments range in size from \Sexpr{myform(100 * temptab.prop[6,6])}\% to \Sexpr{myform(100 * temptab.prop[1,6])}\%. Table~\ref{T:demo_vs_segs} shows the distribution of the demographic variables across the segments. These distributions are calculated by summing the post-stratification weights of all respondents who fall in a specific category (e.g. all males). Segment membership is incorporated by weighting the post-stratification weights with the estimates of each respondent's posterior segment-membership probabilities in \eqref{E:posterior}. The segments differ with respect to socio-demographic characteristics. Segment 3 has a large group of people who are lower educated females, aged primarily above 60. In Segment 6, the majority is highly educated young males, while Segment 4 includes higher educated people, both male and female, who are mostly aged 35--59. Segment 5 includes more people with low education levels than average.
%There are some interesting differences in the demographic composition of the value segments, which we will point out in the subsequent discussion.

% These seven value segments are based on different value priorities. To help interpret these priorities, all the response categories and values are represented jointly in a two-dimensional space using biplots (see Figures~\ref{F:biplots1} -- \ref{F:biplots3}). The positions of the value items vary across all value segments, but the locations of the response categories remain the same. The magnitude of the effect of each item on the probability to endorse a specific rating category is determined by the inner product (also known as the scalar or dot product) between the position of the item in that segment and the vector representing the rating. This can be determined by multiplying the length of the projection of the item point onto the rating vector by the length of the rating vector. Simply put, items which have large positive projections are associated with large probabilities of endorsing that rating, and vice versa. For example, in Segment 1 the item PO1 has a very large positive projection on rating category 6 (``Not like me at all''), which implies that in Segment 1 people do not value this item highly. In contrast, UN1 has a large positive projection on rating category 1 (``Very much like me''), implying that this segment values this aspect of universalism most highly. 

% We first interpret each value segment, and then relate these to voting behaviour in the next section. To ease interpretation, names are assigned to the segments:

% \emph{Segment 1: Mainstream}. The `Mainstream' group forms the largest segment comprising roughly \Sexpr{myform(100 * segprop[1])}\% of the sample. From Figure~\ref{F:biplots1}, we see that this segment attaches great importance to values universalism (UN1: equal treatment and opportunities for everyone; and UN2: understanding others), benevolence (BE2: loyalty and devotion to friends and family; and BE1: helping others and caring about their well-being),  and self-direction (SD1: being independent). Values such as power (PO1: being rich; and PO2: being respected by others),  achievement (AC2: being successful; AC1: and being admired) as well as stimulation (ST2: living an exciting life), are considered to be completely unimportant. This is mostly in line with the pan-cultural hierarchy of \citet{schwartz2001}. We might consider this segment to represent the modal person in the Netherlands.
% The `Mainstream' group forms the largest segment comprising roughly \Sexpr{myform(100*temptab.prop[1,6])}\% of the sample. From Figure~\ref{F:biplots}, we see that this segment attaches great importance to values such as equal treatment and opportunities for everyone (UN1), loyalty and devotion to friends and family (BE2), helping others and caring about their well-being (BE1), understanding others (UN2) and to being independent (SD1). Values such as being rich (PO1), living an exciting life (ST2), being successful (AC2) and admired (AC1) as well as being respected by others (PO2) are considered to be completely unimportant. This segment therefore considers benevolence and universalism most important and opposes self-enhancement and power in particular, mostly in line with the findings of \citet{schwartz2001}. The people in this segment are somewhat older than average, \Sexpr{myform(100*demotab["Female",1])}\% are women compared to the average of \Sexpr{myform(100*demotab["Female",8])}\%, and they have an average level of education. They were somewhat less supportive of the VVD and more supportive of the CDA and SP over the period 2002 --- 2010, compared to the overall results. It can be expected that this segment will vote left, are non-religious and neither libertarian or authoritarian\todo{why?}.
%This segment showed great support for the CDA in the elections of 2002, 2003 and 2006, with voting ranging from 31.6\% in 2002 to 29.7\% in 2006. However, in 2010 support for the CDA dropped to only 18.4\% in this segment, in line with the overall trend in the election results. The main benefactors of this drop in support for the CDA seems to have been the left-wing parties PVV (10.2\% in 2010) and the SP, which attracted 10.2\% and 12.4\% of their votes in 2010\todo{Expect voting left, non-religious, neither libertarian nor authoritarian.}. 
%A total of xx\% of those in this segment voted in the most recent elections. Expect voting left, non-religious, neither libertarian nor authoritarian.

% \emph{Segment 2: Security Seekers}. The `Security Seekers'  (\Sexpr{myform(100*segprop[2])}\%) do not have any pronounced preference for or aversion to any particular values. They consider all values to be of approximately equal importance. However, in comparison to the other segments, they consider security (SE1 and SE2) relatively more important. Further, benevolence (BE2: being loyal to friends and family) and self-direction (SD1: independence) are considered important. As in most other segments, they consider power (PO1: being rich) and stimulation (ST2: living an exciting life) to be relatively unimportant. Interestingly, tradition (TR2: modesty) is also considered to be relatively unimportant.
% The `Security Seekers'\todo{Why this name?} (\Sexpr{myform(100*temptab.prop[2,6])}\%) consider all values to be of approximately equal importance; they do not have any pronounced preference or aversion for any particular values. Being loyal to friends and family (BE2) and independence (SD1) are considered important. As in the other segments, they consider being rich (PO1) and living an exciting life (ST2) to be relatively unimportant. Interestingly, modesty (TR2) is also considered to be unimportant. This segment has a relatively average socio-demographic profile, with somewhat more higher educated people than average. It can be expected that this segment will vote has less outspoken preferences and will vote for traditional middle parties (PvdA, CDA) and new parties. 
%The people in this segment have an average age of 50.2 years and a slightly lower than average number of years of education (11.9 years). They are equally divided between men and women. From this segment, 72.8\% voted in the most recent elections: the lowest percentage in the random sample. Expect not voting (less outspoken preferences; voting for new parties )

% \emph{Segment 3: Traditionalists}. Compared to the other segments, the `Traditionalists' (\Sexpr{myform(100*segprop[3])}\%) emphasize the conservation values (security, conformity and tradition) far more than the other segments. People in this segment consider it to be especially important that the area in which they live is safe (SE1: security) and that traditions are respected (TR1: tradition). Contrary to many of the other segments, they consider the item gaining new experiences (ST1: stimulation) to be of only minor importance. The key motivation for people in this segment are conservation and socially-oriented values.
% Compared to the other segments, the `Traditionalists' (\Sexpr{myform(100*temptab.prop[3,6])}\%) consider it to be especially important that the area in which they live is safe (SE1) and that traditions are respected (TR1). Contrary to many of the other segments, they consider gaining new experiences (ST1) to be of only minor importance. This segment includes many older persons -- \Sexpr{myform(100*demotab["60-96",3])}\% are older than 60 years -- with lower levels of education. The segment is slightly dominated by women (\Sexpr{myform(100*demotab["Female",3])}\%). We expect right-wing and religious  inclinations from this group. %In this segment, 82.6\% voted in the most recent elections. Expect right wing voting; religious; authoritarian

% \emph{Segment 4: Universalists}. The fourth value segment, the ‘Universalists’ (\Sexpr{myform(100*segprop[4])}\%), places relatively great emphasis on self-direction (SD1: independence; and SD2: creativilty), universalism (UN1 to UN3), and also benevolence (BE2: loyalty to friends and family). Values in the conservation domain such as tradition (TR) and conformity (CO) are not considered important. Values representing growth are the motivation of people in this segment.
% The fourth  value segment, the ‘Universalists’ (\Sexpr{myform(100*temptab.prop[4,6])}\%), places relatively great emphasis on independence (SD1), universalism (UN1 to UN3), creativity (SD2) and also on loyalty to friends and family (BE2). Values in the conservation domain such as tradition (TR) and conformity (CO) are not considered important. This segment is both relatively young and highly educated. 

% \emph{Segment 5: Indifferent}. This segment, simply named `Indifferent,' consists of individuals who hardly differentiated between the values. They comprise roughly \Sexpr{myform(100*segprop[5])}\% of the sample. All values are considered of average importance. Self-direction (SD1: being independent) and benevolence (BE2: being loyal to family and friends) are the values considered relatively most important to them.

This segment has somewhat lower education levels  %Interestingly, this segment showed the largest support for the PVV in the last election, with roughly 22.7\% of their votes. At the same time this segment reduced their support of the CDA and the PvdA by roughly more than 10\% each.

% \emph{Segment 6: Entrepreneurs}. The `Entrepreneurs' (\Sexpr{myform(100*segprop[6])}\%) consider the values self-direction (SD1 and SD2), benevolence (BE2: loyalty to friends and family), and hedonism (HE2: having fun) to be extremely important. Universalism is considered relatively less important. Relative to the other segments, power and achievement are more important, while tradition and conformity are considered less important. Person-focused values are the key motivation for the people in this segment. 
% `The Entrepreneurs' (\Sexpr{myform(100*temptab.prop[6,6])}\%) consider the values of independence (SD1), loyalty to friends and family (BE2), creativity (SD2) and having fun (HE2) to be extremely important. Universalism are relatively less important. Relative to the other segments, power (PO) and achievement (AC) are more important than in the other segments. Modesty (TR2), following rules (CO1) and traditions (TR1) as well as behaving properly (CO2) are considered less important. Values in the domains of self-transcendence and openness-to-change are considered significantly more important than values in the domains of self-advancement and conservation. This segment is the dominated by men (\Sexpr{myform(100*demotab["Male",6])}\%), is highly educated and \Sexpr{myform(100*demotab["15-34",6])}\% are between 15 and 34 years of age. %Politically, they have shown a lot of support for D66 in the last election (18\%) compared to other segmetns. Their support for CDA has also been relatively low, while support for the VVD is relatively high. \todo{A total of xx\% voted at the most recent elections. Libertarian, non-religiousright wing}.

% \emph{Segment 7: Uninterested}. The smallest segment consists of \Sexpr{myform(100*segprop[7])}\% of individuals who are seemingly not interested in completing the entire value scale. This may have been an issue with the data collection or recording. In the ESS questionnaire, the values were divided over two pages and the respondents might have missed the second page. As is evident from the biplot in Figure~\ref{F:biplots3}, roughly half the items have been completed (the items in the lower half of the plot), while responses to the remaining nine items are mostly missing. This corresponds to the order in which the items appeared in the questionnaire.
% The smallest segment consists of 1.1\% of individuals who are seemingly uninterested in completing the entire value scale. This may have been an issue with the data collection or recording, but it is not possible to tell. As is evident from the biplot in Figure~\ref{F:biplots}, roughly half the items have been completed (the items in the lower half of the plot) while responses to the remaining nine items are mostly missing. This is also apparent from inspecting the data. The distribution of these type of responses are roughly uniform across the five waves of the ESS. Due to the problems with the data for this segment, it is not interpreted any further.

% \subsection{Response style segments}
% When \todo{This and the following sections must be rewritten/filled in}employing the LC-BML model, 20 response style segments were identified which reflected the response style segments found in \citet{vanrosmalen2010} \todo{Proposal: mention that these segments exist. Show that the segments 5 and 7 are correlated with serious response styles such as acquTable~\ref{T:partyvsseg} shows the reported voting behaviour for the value segments, using the adjusted post-stratification weights. This gives an idea of the overall popularity of the political parties in each of the segments. In a later section we will discuss how this evolved over time. However, we first describe each of the value segments in terms of their socio-demographic composition (Table~\ref{T:demo_vs_segs}), the relative importance attached to the human values (Figure~\ref{F:biplots}) and their overall association with the political parties (Table~\ref{T:partyvsseg}). Each of the segments are assigned a name to help with the interpretation.iescence or many missing values}. There are two generally positive segments, in which respondents primarily use the categories 1 to 3 (together making up 41.9\%), one segment with weak acquiescence (16.1\%), one segment in which all categories are used (11.4\%), mid-point responding (9.8\%), avoidance of extreme categories (8.5\%), strong acquiescence (5.1\%), primarily 2s and 5s (4.7\%), many negative categories (1.7\%) and many missing responses (0.8\%). Four of the segments have scores that could indicate bias: the avoidance of extreme categories, strong acquiescence, only 2s and 5s, disacquiescence and many missing responses (missing values). Bias suggests a systematic error in responses. This kind of error occurs because respondents have a tendency to use the response scale systematically, irrespective of their opinion. Acquiescence is the tendency on the part of respondents to use the positive end of the response scale, regardless of the question posed. Disaquiescence is the opposite of acquiescence. People with this response style choose one of the negative response categories for the questions, again irrespective of the content of the question.
% 
% Value segments and response style segments may show correlations. When the two types of segments are independent of each other, all of the response styles occur equally frequently in relative terms in each value segment. If there is dependency this can indicate more bias in one or more value segments. The current results indicate that the response style segments strong acquiescence, scores 2 and 5, disacquiescence and missing values occur relatively frequently in the value segment III `Conformists'. In value segment I `Traditionalists', the response style segment in which extreme categories are avoided is slightly larger.

\end{figure}

To gain insight into the relationship between value segments and voting over time, we performed a correspondence analysis \citep[CA; e.g.][]{hoffman1986, greenacre2007}. CA can be used to analyse and vizualize the value segments together with the political parties for which they voted. This makes it easier to interpret our results. For this analysis, a cross-tabulation of the individual posterior probabilities in Equation \eqref{E:posterior} was made with the value segments in the columns and the political parties, split into the five waves of the ESS, in the rows. The CA was used to assess the links between the rows and columns in this table simultaneously (see Figure~\ref{F:CA-plot}). The results in the table can be shown effectively in two dimensions (with a fit of 78.6\% in two dimensions).

Figure~\ref{F:CA-plot} shows the column-principal map of the CA \citep{greenacre2007}, where each of the political parties are labelled, and each year is plotted in a separate panel. We use colours to categorize the parties according to their background: green for religious, red for socialist, blue for right-wing political parties, black for the populist parties, and yellow for the libertarian parties. The black triangles represent the seven value segments. The darker the points, the better the explained inertia (fit) of the points -- see \citet{greenacre2007} for more information on inertia. Across the five waves, three value segments are quite distinct, namely the Segments III, IV, and VI. Segment I is located in between the Segments III and IV and lies more towards the centre of the graph. Segments V and VII lie close together; however, Segment VII fits less well into the CA solution, suggesting possible measurement issues in this segment. Last, Segment II also fit less well into the display and should therefore not be strongly interpreted.

The first dimension divides Segment III from Segments IV and VI. In value terms this is a distinction between having an emphasis on the three values conformity, tradition, and security or de-emphasizing these values. The second dimension is a distinction between Segment IV, and to a lesser extent Segment III, and Segment VI. This is a distinction between an emphasis on universalism values versus achievement values. The first dimension distinguishes the religious parties (SGP, CU and CDA) from the non-religious parties (e.g., GL, D66 and VVD). The second dimension distinguishes the libertarian parties (GL and PvdD) from the right-wing party (VVD) and the populist parties.

The religious parties lie in the upper left quadrant, strongly associated with Segment III. They are ordered from the most traditional SGP to the more moderate CDA, and are clearly distinguished from the libertarian and authoritarian parties towards the right of the graph. The libertarian and left parties, namely the PvdD, D66, GL and PvdA, are located alongside each other to the top right quadrant of the figure. The more strict libertarian left-wing parties, the GL and PvdD, are located in the upper right corner, whereas the more centrist PvdA is located towards the origin. The populist and right wing parties form a tight cluster slightly below the centre. These parties (LPF, PVV, VVD and LN) have tight historical connections, as for instance the populist LPF was formed by a former member of LN, and the PVV leader similarly was a former member of parliament for the right-wing VVD. 

In a volatile political landscape, the party voted for may change over time and and we postulate that segments vote for the party most congruent with their values. Contrary to basic human values, political values are less stable over time; in particular, basic human values underlie specific political values (Schwartz, 1994). In Figure~\ref{F:CA-plot}, the religious parties hardly change position over time: they remain closest to Segment III over the years. The left-wing parties (PvdA and SP) have moved towards the libertarian parties and closer to each other. The right-wing party remained at about the same position over time; however, it is also this position that some populist parties have taken. The only populist party that took a position in between segments IV and VI appeared (and disappeared) in 2010. Finally, the non-voters are located close to the populist parties; this position hardly changed over time. 


In the final results section, we show that our values segments are predictive of voting.

To validate the values segments obtained and discussed above, we performed a multinomial logistic regression analysis to predict voting using values segment membership probabilities. The dependent variable has six categories: five categories for political orientation (left-wing, libertarian, populist, religious, or right-wing), and the sixth category is reserved for non-voters. Also, combining parties ensures that each category has enough observations to be modelled. The independent variables used are socio-demographics, the ESS wave number (wave 2002 as a reference), and the values segment membership probabilities. We estimate nested models to provide insight into the additional predictive value of each step.

Table~\ref{T:anova-mlogit} compares multinomial logit models using likelihood ratio tests. The models are listed in order of increasing complexity. All the effects included are main effects.

The results are shown in Table~\ref{T:mlogit-fit}. Differences in voting for political parties can be explained by both socio-demographics and value segment membership. Voters are higher educated and older than non-voters (coefficients for education and age are negative and significant); only voters for the populist parties are more similar to the non-voters in age. Voters for the right wing party are more often male (.21, p < .01) and less often belong to the low and middle education categories (-1.93 and -.84, both p < .001). The coefficients for the waves show whether a political orientation gained or lost votes over the years. These results show that in the 2010 election the religious parties lost votes to non-voters (reference category). Furthermore, after 2002 populist parties lost votes, but this trend is turning in 2010.

The seven values segments help predict which group of parties is voted for. People belonging to segment I vote either for the left-wing parties (.77, p <.01), for libertarian (1.70, p <.01) or for the religious parties (.97, p <.001), whereas people in segment II tend to vote right-wing (1.21, p <.001) or libertarian (1.31, p < .05). Segment III, with strong traditional values, prefers the religious parties over the other parties (1.26, p <.001). Segment IV votes for either left wing (.93, p <.001) or libertarian parties (2.19, p < .001). Segment V is interesting as people in this segment seem to be against voting; we can see that the coefficients do not differ from the non-voters. Lastly segment VI votes for the right wing party (1.16, p < .001 ) or for one of the libertarian parties (1.37, p < .05). The libertarian parties compete for voters from 4 segments (I, II, IV and VI); the religious parties obtain voters from 1 segment (III).

We expected that we would find a segment emphasizing universalism, self-direction and stimulation values and opposing power and security values voting for libertarian parties; segment IV has a strong preference for libertarian parties, confirming hypothesis 1. We further expected that there would be a segment emphasizing power and security values important and opposing universalism values unimportant voting for right-wing parties. We did not find such a segment; therefore we reject hypothesis 2. We also find that there is a segment (III) emphasizing the three values security, conformity and tradition, opposing the values self-direction, stimulation and hedonism and which  considers benevolence a stronger guiding principle than universalism voting for religious parties. We thus accept hypothesis 3. 

% \subsection*{VALUE SEGMENTS AND POLITICAL PARTIES}
% Table~\ref{T:partyvsseg} shows the reported voting behaviour for the value segments, using the adjusted post-stratification weights. This gives an idea of the overall popularity of the political parties in each of the segments. In a later section we will discuss how this evolved over time. However, we first describe each of the value segments in terms of their socio-demographic composition (Table~\ref{T:demo_vs_segs}), the relative importance attached to the human values (Figure~\ref{F:biplots}) and their overall association with the political parties (Table~\ref{T:partyvsseg}). Each of the segments are assigned a name to help with the interpretation.

% To relate the value segments to voting over time we performed a correspondence analysis \citep[CA; e.g.][]{hoffman1986, greenacre2007}. CA can be used to plot the value segments together with the political parties for which they voted. This makes it easier to interpret our results. For this analysis, a cross-tabulation of the individual posterior probabilities in Equation \eqref{E:posterior} was made with the value segments in the columns and the political parties, split into the five waves of the ESS, in the rows. The CA was used to visualize the links between the rows and columns in this table simultaneously (see Figure~\ref{F:CA-plot}). The total inertia in the table can be effectively shown in two dimensions (\Sexpr{myform(100*cumsum(CAres$sv^2 / sum(CAres$sv^2))[2])}\% of the inertia is explained in two dimensions).

% Correspondence Analysis \citep[CA; e.g.][]{hoffman1986} can be used to plot the segments together with the political parties for which they voted. This makes it easier to interpret our results. For this analysis, cross-tabulation was applied with the value segments in the columns and votes for the political parties in 2002, 2003 and 2006 and 2010 in the rows. The CA was used to visualize the links between the rows and columns in the table simultaneously (see Figure~\ref{F:ca}). The total inertia in the table can be effectively shown in two dimensions (82.1\% of the inertia); the other dimensions contribute only marginally. Votes for parties other than the ones reported here (see Table~\ref{T:parties}) were discounted from this analysis, as was blank and missing votes. 

% Figure~\ref{F:CA-plot} shows the column-principal map of the CA \citep{greenacre2007}, where each of the political parties are labelled. In addition, each year is indicated by a different symbol. Symbols for the same party are connected by lines. The black triangles represent the seven value segments. The darker the points, the better the explained inertia (fit) of the points -- see \citet{greenacre2007} for more information on inertia. Across the five waves, three value segments are quite distinct, namely the Traditionalists, the Universalists, and the Entrepreneurs. The Mainstrean segment is located in between the Tradionalists and the Universalists and lie more towards the centre of the graph. The Indifferent and Uninterested segments lie close together; however, the Uninterested segment fits less well into the CA solution, suggesting possible measurement issues in this segment. Last, the Security Seekers also fit less well into the display and should therefore not be strongly interpreted.

% Figure~\ref{F:ca} shows the column-principal map of the CA \citep{greenacre2007}, where each of the political parties are labelled by the party code and the year of the ESS wave. For example, `10 CU' refers to the 2010 data for the CU political party. Furthermore, large dots indicate the latest sample for every party, often that of 2010, while smaller dots representing previous ESS waves are connected to the large ones. The lightest dots refer to the 2002 sample, while the darkest colour indicates the 2010 sample. In this way it is possible to see whether there were significant shifts in how the political parties were related to the value segments over the five ESS waves.\todo{Say something about the inertia explained for each point}

% The first dimension divides the Traditionalists from the Universalists and Entrepreneurs. In value terms this is a distinction between conservation and openness-to-change. The second dimension is a distinction between Universalists, and to a lesser extent Traditionalists, and the Entrepreneurs. This is a distinction between an emphasis on self-transcendence versus self-enhancement. The first dimension distinguishes the religious parties (SGP, CU and CDA) from the non-religious parties (e.g., GL and D66); this meets our expectation that segments considering conservation and self-transcendence important more often vote for religious parties.

% The religious parties lie in the upper left quadrant, strongly associated with the Traditionalist segment. They are ordered from the most traditional SGP to the more moderate CDA, and clearly distinguished from the libertarian and authoritarian parties towards the right of the graph. The libertarian parties, namely the PvdD, D66, GL and PvdA, are located alongside each other to the top right quadrant of the figure. The more extreme libertarian parties, namely the GL and PvdD, are located in the upper right corner, whereas the more centrist PvdA are located towards the origin. The authoritarian parties form a tight cluster slightly below the centre. These parties (LPF, PVV, VVD and LN) have tight historical connections, as for instance the LPF was formed by a former member of LN, and the PVV leader similarly was a former member of parliament for the VVD. 

% Members of the Indifferent segment as well as the Entrepreneurs are the most avid supporters of the newly established authoritarian parties. In addition to voting for the VVD, in the elections in 2002 and 2003 these segments voted relatively often for LPF and LN, and since 2006 for the populist PVV. For the Entrepreneurs, universalism is relatively unimportant compared to the other segments. This is congruent with their preference for authoritarian parties, and our expectations. Individuals emphasizing conservation values tend to vote more often for religious parties, especially the SGP and CU. This is in line with our expectations. 

% As expected, the Universalist segment, which opposes the protection and conservation values and emphasizes growth and openness-to-change values, votes for libertarian parties such as GL. 
% 
% Alternative votes for these parties, especially the CU and CDA, come from the Mainstream segment. 
% 
% The Uninterested segment does not fit well into the plot (explained inertia of only 11.7\%\todo{recalculate this value}) and is therefore not interpreted.
% 
% As values of aggregate groups remain quite stable over time (ref), we may consider the segments as stable and the parties as entities that may be less or more congruent with segments' values. The authoritarian VVD has remained attractive to the Security Seekers and to a lesser extent to the Entrepreneurs. Also the populist PVV maintains a stable position over the last two elections; its voters are in the segments of security seekers, and indifferent. The labour party, PvdA, has a lower inertia in the CA and is located in the center of the graph; this implies that it can be considered congruent with the values of the mainstream segment but has no strong relation with any of the more disinct segments. 
% 
% The libertarian D66 has a stable position in between the Entrepreneurs and Universalists. The libertarian GL has moved back towards the centre of the figure after making a strong move in the direction of the Universalists during the 2006 elections. Indeed, GL shows a large variability in terms of its position in the upper right quadrant; however, its congruence with openness vales that are shared by all sgments on the right hand side of the graph is evident. The new established libertarian party, PvdD has seen a significant shift towards the Universalist segment, especially between the 2006 and 2010 elections; a vote for the PvdD seems congruent with the universalists segment.
% 
% The religious centre party CDA, moved away from the centre towards the Mainstream and Traditionalist groups; its congruence with the mainstresam and traditionalist value segments became stronger in the years 2008 and 2010. The religious CU maintained a stable position in proximity of the CDA as well as the Mainstream and Traditionalist segments. The SGP remain closely associated with the Traditionalists segment that emphasizes conservation values.
% 
% The first dimension mainly divides the religious parties (SGP, CU and CDA) from the non-religious parties (e.g. GL and SP). The second dimension divides the more right-wing VVD and PVV from the religious and the left-wing parties. The libertarian parties D66, GL, SP and PvdA are located alongside each other to the right of the centre of the figure.
% 
% Each of the segments have a distinctive position on the two dimensions. On the first dimension, the Traditionalists are mainly separated from the Entrepreneurs and Universalists. The Traditionalists vote for SGP and CU relatively frequently compared to the other segments, given the closeness of these points. Also, the Universalists (Segment 4) vote relatively frequently for GL and PvdD, as can be expected. The Entrepreneurs are avid supporters of the VVD, and lately also of the D66.  Members of the Indifferent segment as well as the Security Seekers are the most avid supporters of the far-right PVV, relative to the other parties. The Uninterested group does not fit well into the plot (explained inertia of only 11.7\%) and is therefore not interpreted.

% With respect to shifts in values, the position of the VVD has remained attractive to the Security Seekers and to a lesser extent to the Entrepreneurs. The PvdA has shifted somewhat towards the Traditionalists during the last election, while the CDA has moved towards the Mainstream and Traditionalist groups. The PVV maintains a stable position over the last two elections. The libertarian D66 has moved back towards the Entrepreneurs after being relatively more attractive to the Mainstream and Universalists during the 2006 elections. This reflects a move back towards their traditional position when the elections of 2002 and 2003 are considered. GL has moved back towards the centre of the figure after making a strong move in the direction of the Universalists during the 2006 elections. Indeed, GL shows a large variability in terms of its position in the upper right quadrant. The CU maintained a stable position in proximity of the CDA as well as the Mainstream and Traditionalist segments. The SGP remain closely associated with the Traditionalists, although there was also some association with the Uninterested group during the 2010 elections.
% The position of the political parties relative to the segments varies for the elections of 2002 (ESS 2002), 2003 (ESS 2004 and 2006), 2006 (ESS 2008) and 2010 (ESS 2010). 
% 
% The PvdD has seen a significant shift towards Universalist values, especially between the 2006 and 2010 elections. 
% 
% The position of the religious parties SGP, CU and CDA are relatively stable, as is also the case for the libertarian party D66. Shifts can be seen for other parties; GroenLinks gained a more outspoken position in the period 2002 to 2006 and the VVD has also shifted from a central position to a more peripheral position on the graph. For GroenLinks, this means that they now have more voters with the value profile of segments VII `the Egalitarians' and above all VI `the Independents'. For VVD, this means that in the years 2002 and 2003 it attracted voters from all segments, but in 2006 it attracted relatively more voters from segment V `the Innovators' and relatively few from, for example, segment I `the Traditionalists'. Another noticeable shift over the years can be seen for SP. In 2002, SP attracted relatively large numbers of voters from the segments VI `the Independents' and VII `the Egalitarians'. In 2006, SP shifted closer to the origin of the graph. This means that people from several segments now vote for SP.

% The shift in support for the parties over time and their position relative to other parties provides an indication of the extent to which the party competes with other parties in the various segments. If a party is close to another party, this means that people are likely to find both parties equally attractive in the elections. For example, Figure~\ref{F:CA-plot} shows that the CU and CDA attract similar voters, as does the VVD and the PVV. This means that these parties attract voters with the same value priorities. 
% Proximity to the origin of the plot implies that parties The PvdA and the CDA are close together near the origin of the graph, which means that they have voters from all segments and compete strongly against each other. In the figure, the new parties LPF, LN and PVV are extremely close to the `non-voting' category. Segment III ` the Conformists', situated very close to this, primarily chooses between not voting or voting for a populist party. Segment III is less likely to vote for libertarian or religious parties.

% The value segments analyzed above are adjusted for response styles through the inclusion of the response style segments in the model. Figure~\ref{F:respstyle-plot} gives the proportion of responses in each response style segment that was attributed to each of the ratings. Colours are used to highlight larger values. It is evident that a variety of response styles have been detected. The largest styles (1 -- 3) concentrate on using ratings one through five, but very few sixes. Response style 4 focuses on using ratings two and three, while response style 5 uses the breadth of the rating scale. Styles 9 and 10 can be described as midpoint scoring, while style 16 comprise extreme scoring focusing on categories 1 and 6. Response styles 18 and 20 contain a disproportionate number of missing values. These results show that there is indeed a lot of heterogeneity with respect to rating scale use. 

% Figure~\ref{F:respstyle-valuesegment-rows} shows the association between the response style and value segments. The percentages in each column sums to one, showing which segments each response style is associated with. Note that some response style segments are often strongly associated with a single value segment. This is especially true for the Indifferent and Uninterested segments. Specifically, the Uninterested segment associates strongly with response styles 18 and 20 (missing values), and the Indifferent segment with response styles 13 -- 16 and 19. The latter include some well-known styles \citep[see][for example]{baumgartner2001}, such as response range (13), acquiescence (14 and 15), extreme responding (16) and disacquiescence (19).

\section*{Discussion and Conclusion}

% \todo in discussion section more attention for the relation between values and voting; less focus on 3 categorieen in Nederland. laat het meer algemeen zodat het ook op USA kan slaan. Verder focus op reponse tendencies en voting. Discuss antecedents of RS (desinterest etc). Belang van meenemen RS voor begrijpen van de relatie tussen values en gedragingen. LET OP: segmenten zijn gebaseerd op values; de warden komne er pas later bij! ook voor andere gedragingen is het een probleem dat mensen de questionnaire niet serieus invullen.

There is a clear link between the seven value segments based on Schwartz' values and people's voting behaviour for political parties. Our approach using the LC-BML model, followed by a multinonial regression and a correspondence analysis, clearly reveals distinct value segments that are attracted to different political parties. The religious, left-wing/libertarian and right-wing parties each appeal to people with different distinct values profiles. People with less outspoken values profiles feel attracted to the populist parties or do not vote. 

This study distinguishes itself from previous studies on human values and voting in multiple ways. First, we focus on segments instead of considering the whole population as one group. Specifically, we relate value segments to voting for specific political parties. With our approach we are not only able to confirm established relationships between single values and political orientation, such as a correlation between the value universalism and a left-wing orientation \citep[e.g,][]{caprara2006}, but also to determine which combinations of values are related to voting behaviour. In this we confirm the existence of a values structure showing the oppositions and compatibities between values of an individual as shown by Borg et al. (2015) and are able to relate this to specific political orientations. Second, we correct for response styles, which is a neglected issue in research on human values and voting. Third, our study is the first that shows the relationship between values and voting behaviour over a period longer than a decade; the longitudinal study by \citet{schwartz2010} covered one month. Fourth, we treat all 21 value items separately, instead of reducing the items to the 10 values they set out to measure \citep{piurko2011,caprara2006}, or to their respective higher-order value domains, such as self-transcendence and conservation \citep{barnea1998}. We are able to show that value segments not only differ with respect to the importance they attach to (higher-order) values, but also with respect to specific items. For example, in most segments the two items measuring power are far apart. Also segments distinguish themselves on universalism focused on nature, separating segment VI from the other segments; the latter result would have been hidden when all universalism items would have been combined in one score for universalism.  

The LC-BML model identified 20 different response style segments, providing further empirical evidence of the prevalence of response styles in rating scale data. Importantly, our results show that the value segments and response style segments are not independent. Two more problematic value segments, namely segments V and VII in particular, are closely associated with specific response styles. Together, these comprise 15.7\% of the sample. Hence the answers of a significant number of respondents are mainly driven by specific response styles. In the other segments we might consider the way in which people use the rating scale a communication style. With a communication style, no adjustment, or simple adjustments, may suffice \citep{he2015}. Our study indicates that taking into account response styles in value measurement is important, since ignoring response styles can lead to segments that differ only with respect to rating scale use, and not in value preference. Our study also suggests that the response styles present in empirical data are not limited to one specific style such as extreme responding \citep[for example,][]{liu2015,jong2008}: people use many different response styles that all might invalidate our findings.

The relations between the value segments and voting behaviour are quite stable over time. This is in line with the literature that also shows that when change occurs the hierarchy of importance of the values the relative order of importance of the values stays about similar \citep{vecchione2016} . As evidenced in the correspondence analysis (Figure~\ref{F:CA-plot}), specific segments tend to vote for specific (sets of) political parties. For example, segment III tends to vote for the religious parties (SGP, CU and CDA) relatively frequently, whereas segment VI votes more frequently for the right wing party, VVD, or a libertarian party and people in segment IV choose one of the left or libertarian parties. 


A remarkable segment is segment V. This segment either tends not to vote, or, when voting, likely NOT votes for one of the existing parties. They might vote for a populist party, but that is not shown in our results. Looking at the literature, a reason for their (non)-voting might be  value incongruence with the existing parties, as suggested by \citet{caprara2012}. However, the values profile of segment V is not very clear; they consider all values of about equal importance. Value incongruence with specific parties then might be less obvious as we found that they are less likely to vote for all political orientations. Another possibility is that people in Segment V have differentiated less between items in the survey, which might be due to less education or lack of motivation to answer the items (Krosnick, 1991). Still, Segment V is a stable segment in our correspondence analysis, indicating that such a segment is valid and stable and will likely not vote, or when they vote may choose one of the newly emerging (populist) parties.



% The LC-BML model identified 20 response style segments, providing further empirical evidence of the prevalence of response styles in rating scale data. Importantly, our results show that the value and response style segments are not independent. Two problematic value segments, namely the Indifferent and Disinterested segments, are closely associated with specific response styles. Together, these comprise myform(100 * sum(segprop[c(5, 7)]))\% of the sample. Hence the answers of a significant number of respondents are mainly driven by specific response styles. In the value items studied here, the response styles seem to be more than a communication style \citep[see also][]{he2015}. For communication styles, no adjustment, or simple adjustments such as ipsatization, may suffice. In contrast, our study shows that this is not sufficient since response styles are related to substantive content and a correction for response style bias is necessary.

% In the first decade of this century, the differences between the political parties widened. PvdA and CDA remained centrist parties that attract people from almost all segments. This creates difficulties for political marketing that appeals to human values because people from a wide variety of segments are being addressed by these parties. A key implication of these findings is that many political parties could present themselves by focusing on the segments that most closely reflect their own values. For example, SGP voters are primarily in the Traditionalist segment, and hence the SGP can emphasize the value `attempting to adhere to the customs acquired from one's faith or family'.


% Two of the value segments, namely the Security Seekers and the Uninterested segment, fit less well in the CA. Of these, the Security Seekers represent a significant proportion of the population. Multiple reasons may explain this lack of fit in the CA solution. For example, people in these segments might be less interested in politics or might have the feeling that current political doesn’t not align with their political stance. This might result in not voting or in voting for the new emerging parties. 

% Secondly, it might be due to response styles used. The people in these segments mainly had specific response styles using only a small part of the rating scale. Mostly only two rating categories were ticked, indicative of acquiescence or non-differentiation. 

Our results also pose interesting questions for further research. For example, we have seen that Segment III has shrunk between 2002 and 2010, while segment IV has grown over the same period. In that period, the Netherlands has become more prosperous, as evidenced by the growth in the GDP per capita. Increased prosperity leads people to consider postmodernist values such as independence to be more important \citep{inglehart2000}, making a segment considering universalism values important larger. Further research might focus on value change and the effects that might have on the size of our respective value segments and on voting behaviour. The LC-BML model is able to detect groups of persons who did not provide much substantive information in their responses, as evidenced by Segment  V. For these segments, it is difficult to gauge their true opinions from the data. This is a significant finding since it shows that also in well-designed surveys advanced analysis methods can only extract limited information for a substantial number of respondents. Further research might focus on determining why such persons answer in the way they do, and how survey design elements can be used to counteract this type of noninformative responding. Fortunately, these persons tend to answer using a small set of typical response styles, enabling survey researchers to detect them.

% \section*{Discussion and Conclusion}
% There is a clear link between the seven value segments based on Schwartz' values and people's voting behaviour for political parties. Our approach using the LC-BML model, followed by a correspondence analysis, clearly reveals the three factors identified in the literature according to which political parties in the Netherlands may be categorized \citep{aarts2008}. We can see religious parties (SGP, CU and CDA), left-leaning (GL, SP, PvdD) versus right-leaning parties (VVD and PVV) and libertarian (D66, GL) versus more liberal and traditional parties. The division between right and left applied widely in the literature is therefore too simplistic to effectively describe multi-party political systems, such as the Dutch system. Importantly, our method can be applied in other multi-party contexts too.

% This study distinguishes itself from previous studies on values and voting in multiple ways. First, we focus on segments instead of considering the whole population as one group. Second, we relate value segments to voting for specific political parties. With our approach we are not only able to confirm established relationships between single values and political orientation, such as correlation between the universalism and a leftist orientation \citep[e.g,][]{caprara2006}, but also to determine which combinations of value items are related to voting behaviour. Third, we correct for response styles, which is a neglected issue in research on values and voting. It has however long been acknowledged as an issue in public opinion research \citep[for example,][]{peter2011,greenleaf1992,alwin1985,bachman1984,cunningham1977,oneill1967}. Fourth, our study is the first that shows the relationship between values and voting behaviour over a period longer than a decade; the longitudinal study by \citet{schwartz2010} covered one month. 

% Fifth, we treat all 21 value items separately, instead of reducing the items to the 10 values they set out to measure \citep{piurko2011,caprara2006}, or to their respective value domains, such as self-transcendence and conservation \citep{barnea1998}. The value segments not only differ with respect to the importance they attach to values, but also with respect to specific items. For example, in most segments the two items measuring power are far apart, as are the items measuring universalism. The average for power and stimulation, as would be used when analysing value domains only, would have masked that a similar importance is attached to two different value items PO1 (rich) and ST2 (adventure). The LC-BML model accepts correlated items, allowing us to treat items belonging to the same value separately. 

% The relations between the value segments and voting behaviour are quite stable over time. For example, the Traditionalists tend to vote for the religious parties (SGP and CU) relatively frequently, whereas the Entrepreneurs vote more frequently for the libertarian parties, such as D66 and VVD.  A remarkable segment is the Indifferent segment. This segment either tends not to vote, or, when voting, likely votes for the newly emerging populist parties. Such behaviour is compatible with the results of the Dutch panel study by \citet{meer2012}. However, the reason for their (non)-voting behaviour might be either substantive or methodological. One possible substantive reason is value incongruence with the existing parties, as suggested by \citet{caprara2012}. Another possibility is that populist parties are more engaging to lower educated citizens than the established parties \citep{hakhverdian2012}. Disinterest or lack of cognitive capacity when answering the survey items, resulting in a response style, might be a methodological explanation. 
% The Universalists are more likely to vote for the left-leaning parties GL, PvdD, and SP.

% The LC-BML model identified 20 different response style segments, providing further empirical evidence of the prevalence of response styles in rating scale data. Importantly, our results show that the value and response style segments are not independent. Two problematic value segments, namely the Indifferent and Disinterested segments, are closely associated with specific response styles. Together, these comprise \Sexpr{myform(100 * sum(segprop[c(5, 7)]))}\% of the sample. Hence the answers of a significant number of respondents are mainly driven by specific response styles. In the other segments we might consider the way in which people use the rating scale a communication style. With a communication style, no adjustment, or simple adjustments, may suffice \citep{he2015}. Our study indicates that taking into account response styles in value measurement is important, since ignoring response styles can lead to segments that differ only with respect to rating scale use, and not in value preference. Our study also suggests that the response styles present in empirical data are not limited to one specific style such as extreme responding \citep[for example,][]{liu2015,jong2008}: people use many different response styles that all might invalidate our findings.

In the value items studied here, the response styles seem to be more than a communication style \citep[see also][]{he2015}. For communication styles, no adjustment, or simple adjustments such as ipsatization, may suffice. In contrast, our study shows that this is not sufficient since response styles are related to substantive content and a correction for response style bias is necessary.

% In the first decade of this century, the differences between the political parties widened. PvdA and CDA remained centrist parties that attract people from almost all segments. This creates difficulties for political marketing that appeals to human values because people from a wide variety of segments are being addressed by these parties. A key implication of these findings is that many political parties could present themselves by focusing on the segments that most closely reflect their own values. For example, SGP voters are primarily in the Traditionalist segment, and hence the SGP can emphasize the value `attempting to adhere to the customs acquired from one's faith or family'.

%and the Partij voor de Dieren and GroenLinks `care for the environment' and `equal life opportunities for everyone'.
%People who vote for GroenLinks come mainly from segments VI and VII and the same is true for the Partij voor de Dieren
%In the 2006 elections, the VVD attracted relatively large numbers of votes in segment V `the Innovators', whereas in the 2002 and 2003 elections, the VVD's position was less clear. In those elections, its voters were less likely to come from a specific segment. The position of segment III `'the Conformists' is of particular interest: people in this segment are relatively less likely to vote than other segments and if they do vote, they tend to opt for one of the (new) right-wing populist parties (LPF in 2002 and PVV in 2006). This could mean that people in segment III will again resort to not voting if the expectations people have of the new party are not realized. Segment III ` the Conformists' appears to be less conscientious than other segments in their responses. The people in this segment are more likely to give the same response to the values and sometimes also give random responses, which is why its scores are close to the origin on the graph. This may be an indication of a disinterest that is not confined to politics alone.

% In the first decade of this century, the differences between the political parties widened. PvdA and CDA remained centrist parties that attract people from almost all segments. This creates difficulties for political marketing that appeals to cultural values because people from a wide variety of segments are being addressed by these parties. A key implication of these findings is that many political parties could present themselves by focusing on the segments that most closely reflect their own values. SGP voters are primarily in segment I. People who vote for GroenLinks come mainly from segments VI and VII and the same is true for the Partij voor de Dieren. The SGP can emphasize the value `attempting to adhere to the customs acquired from one's faith or family' and the Partij voor de Dieren and GroenLinks `care for the environment' and `equal life opportunities for everyone'.

% This study of the relationship between values and voting behaviour provides an impetus for further research. We have seen that the Traditionalist segment has shrunk between 2002 and 2010 \todo{Door de stijging van de welvaart is een verschuiving van het op security en conservation gerichte segment naar het meer op openness en universalisme gerichte segment te verklaren. 
% Het zou heel mooi zijn als het  op security en conservation gerichte segment weer groter is in de wave van 2010}. It is possible that this segment was relatively large in size in the 2002 -- 2003 survey as a \todo{Het zou mooi zijn als we hier de link met de verandering in stemgedrag zouden kunnen leggen.}result of the situation within society at that time (recall that two high-profile political assassinations occurred). In the ensuing years there were no attacks in the Netherlands and the economy grew strongly. Increased prosperity leads people to consider postmodernist values such as independence to be more important. The crisis in 2008 caused more economic and social uncertainty; this is likely to have minor effects on the value segments and probably major effects on voting behaviour. One example of this kind of major effect is the substantial number of people who voted for the PVV in the most recent elections (2010). %These are probably people from several segments. The next rounds of the ESS can help to provide an answer to these and other questions about value segments and changes in voting behaviour.
% 
% Lastly, we note that several response style segments, 20 in all, were detected in the data. Also, the Indifferent segment (14.6\%) consisted of people who found it hard to distinguish their value priorities, while the Uninterested segment (1.1\%) consisted of respondents who did not complete all the questions. Even though the European Social Survey is a large, well-designed and good quality survey, it should therefore be noted that there are limitations to what can be concluded from such survey data even with advanced modelling techniques such as the LC-BML model.

\subsection*{Bilinear Decompositions in the LC-BML Model}

We now describe the bilinear decomposition of the parameters used in the LC-BML model. In order to reduce the number of parameters in \eqref{E:linpred}, \citet{vanrosmalen2010} introduce bilinear decompositions which also make it possible to display all effects in $P$-dimensional graphs. Let $\mat{B}_{l}$ be the matrix with $\vect{\beta}_{1l}, \ldots, \vect{\beta}_{Kl}$ as rows, and gather the $\gamma_{jk \, | \, s}$ in the $J \times K$ matrix $\mat{\Gamma}_{s}$. The bilinear restrictions are imposed by requiring that
\begin{equation}
  \mat{B}_{l} = \mat{F} \mat{G}_{l}^{'} \; \text{and} \; \mat{\Gamma}_{s}^{'} = \mat{F} \mat{H}_{s}^{'},
\end{equation}
where $\mat{F}$, $\mat{G}_{l}$ and $\mat{H}_{s}$ has $P$ columns. Typically, the dimensionality of the graphical representations is chosen to be $P = 1$, $2$ or $3$ so that it can be displayed easily. The matrix $\mat{F}$ contains the coordinates of the $K$ rating categories, $\mat{G}_{l}$ the coordinates for the categories of socio-demographic variable $l$, and $\mat{H}_{s}$ the coordinates of the $J$ items in value segment $s$ in $P$-dimensional space. Under these bilinear restrictions, \eqref{E:linpred} becomes
\begin{equation}
  \eta_{ijk \, | \, r, s} = 
      \alpha_{k \, | \, r} + 
      \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{p=1}^{P} f_{kp} \vect{g}_{lp}^{'} \vect{x}_{il} + 
      \sum_{p=1}^{P} f_{kp} h_{jp \, | \, s},
      \label{E:linpred_bilin}
\end{equation}
with $f_{kp}$ and $h_{tp \, | \, s}$ being the elements of $\mat{F}$ and $\mat{H}_{s}$ respectively, and $\vect{g}_{lp}$ the $p$th column of $\mat{G}_{l}$. Besides these bilinear restrictions, several identifiability contraints must be imposed on the parameters in \eqref{E:linpred_bilin} -- details are given in \citet{vanrosmalen2010}.

\subsection*{Biplots}

The biplots produced by the LC-BML model, and constructed based on these bilinear decompositions, are shown in Figures~\ref{F:biplots1} and \ref{F:biplots2}. These are the figures on which the simplified Figure~\ref{F:seg_barplots} are based. The positions of the value items vary across all values segments, but the locations of the response categories remain the same. 

The magnitude of the effect of each item on the probability to endorse a specific rating category is determined by the inner product (also known as the scalar or dot product) between the position of the item in that segment and the vector representing the rating. This can be determined by multiplying the length of the projection of the item point onto the rating vector by the length of the rating vector. Simply put, items which have large positive projections are associated with large probabilities of endorsing that rating, and vice versa. For example, in Segment I the item PO1 has a very large positive projection on rating category 6 (``Not like me at all''), which implies that in Segment I people do not value this item highly. In contrast, item UN1 has a large positive projection on rating category 1 (``Very much like me''), implying that this segment values this aspect of universalism most highly.

\label{T:demo_vs_segs}
\end{table}

To assess whether segments differ on socio-demographic characteristics, we calculated distributions of age, education and gender for the respective segments. These distributions are calculated by summing the post-stratification weights of all respondents who fall in a specific category (e.g., all males). Segment membership is incorporated by weighting the post-stratification weights with the estimates of each respondent's posterior segment-membership probabilities in \eqref{E:posterior}. Table~\ref{T:demo_vs_segs} shows the distribution of the socio-demographic variables across the segments. The segments differ with respect to socio-demographic characteristics. Segment I contains more females (61.1\%) and fewer people younger than 34 (18.6\% versus 31.1\% in the population). Segment II does not differ much from the average in the population. Segment III differs from the average, it comprises relatively more people who are lower educated (40.6\%), female (56.3\%), and aged above 60 (42.0\%). Segment VI distinguishes itself by containing many highly educated (38.1\% versus 24.5\% in the population) and people in the middle age category 35 to 59 (52.2\%). As Segment III, segment V is low educated, but in contrast to segment III there are people in all age categories and relatively more males (53.4\%). In Segment VI, the majority is highly educated (33.3\%) young (62.0\%) and  male (63.3\%). These differences in sociodemographics are in line with relationships between values and sociodemographics found in the literature (Schwartz and Rubel, 2009).

As shown in Table~\ref{T:segsizes_vs_yr}, the sizes of the value segments are relatively stable over time. This is expected as values at a higher aggregation level hardly change \citep{schwartz2006}. Segment IV has grown somewhat over the years from 12.8\% to 16.3\%, whilst Segments III and V have decreased in size from 16.1\% and 16.0\% to 12.3\% and 13.2\% respectively. Overall, Segment VII is estimated to contain only 1.1\% of the population, while the other segments range in size from 14.3\% to 22.0\%. Segment VII consisting of people who had many missing values (no answer) on a subset of the items seems stable across waves of the ESS.
